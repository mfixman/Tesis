The explosion of mobile phone communications in the last years occurs at a moment where data processing power increases exponentially.  Thanks to those two changes in a global scale, the road has been opened to use mobile phone communications to generate inferences and characterizations of mobile phone users.
In this work, we use the communications network, enriched by a set of users' attributes, to gain a better understanding of the demographic features of a population. Namely, we use
call detail records and banking information to infer the income of each person in the graph.
